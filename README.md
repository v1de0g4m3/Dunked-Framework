# Dunked-Framework

A small, simple GMod Menu state injectable. This project is based off of work done by [Leystryku](https://github.com/leystryku) with his project Synchronicity which can be found [here.](https://github.com/Leystryku/Synchronicity)

## Usage
Use your favorite IDE/Compiler and compile the project. 
Use any injector you prefer to inject Dunked-Framework.dll into hl2.exe.
Dunked-Framework will automatically create directories for you on you 'C:\' drive (you can do this manually if you wish).
Included with this project is dunked.lua, which will serve as an example and showcase what functionalities have been implemented into the cheat already. 
In it's current state, Dunked-Framework can only use the functions that are already placed into the Menu state. 
Make sure you place dunked.lua into C:\Dunked\ or else the lua file will not execute.
`print("hello from menustate");`
