# Dunked-Framework

A small, simple GMod Menu state injectable. This project is based off of work done by @Leystryku with his project Synchronicity which can be found [here.](https://github.com/Leystryku/Synchronicity)

## Usage
Use your favorite IDE/Compiler and compile the project. Use whatever injector you perfer to inject Dunked-Framework.dll into gmod.exe. Dunked-Framework will create directories for you on you 'C:\' drive. Included with this project is dunked.lua, which will serve as an example and showcase what functionalities have been implimented into the cheat already. In it's current state, Dunked-Framework can only use the functions that are already placed into the Menu state. Make sure you place dunked.lua into C:\Dunked\ or else the lua file will not execute.
`print("hello from menustate");`
